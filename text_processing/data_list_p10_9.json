        "FINDINGS": " PA and lateral views of the chest provided. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Curvilinear opacity in the right middle lobe is unchanged from chest radiograph ___ likely represents scarring.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.",

        "FINDINGS": " Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated, but appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  The mediastinal contours otherwise unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present due to low lung volumes, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, and could reflect areas of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear nearly resolved, and no pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.",
        "IMPRESSION": " Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, more so on the left.  Findings could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded."

        "FINDINGS": "As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received two left-sided chest tubes to drain a left pleural effusion.  The two tubes are in expected position.  There is no left pneumothorax.  The small left effusion persists.  Areas of atelectasis are seen at the left lung bases. In addition, on the right, the pre-existing pleural effusion persists. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged sternal wires and pacemaker leads.",

No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. Heart is top-normal in size but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. Air distended loops of colon are partially imaged.",
