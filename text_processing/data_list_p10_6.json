The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated to a moderate degree and calcium deposits are seen in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  The lateral view discloses a few semicircular calcifications within the heart shadow at the area of the expected aortic valve.  This finding is strongly suggestive of and confirms the clinical diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis. No suspicious calcifications are seen in the mitral valve area and if left atrial enlargement is present, it appears to be mild to moderate.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
