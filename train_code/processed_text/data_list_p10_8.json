Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has not improved ; presence of any pericardial effusion is radiographically indeterminate.  There may be mild perihilar edema, but this is difficult to diagnose in the setting of effusions. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the upper stomach and out of view. No left pneumothorax."
