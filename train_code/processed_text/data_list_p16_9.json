CONCLUSION The patient is here for multiple fractures secondary to trauma including lower limb fractures. 1.  ET tube is too high and can be advanced for 2.5 cm. 2.  NG tube projects in the stomach but the side port is at the gastroesophageal junction and could also be advanced. 3.  Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities described in the recent CT torso are difficult to assess on this chest x-ray, but they have not significantly increased.  They are nonspecific.  The differential diagnosis includes fat embolism, considering the femoral fracture. The results hav been discussed with the ICU team, DR ___.",

Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis and small accompanying pleural effusion also stable.  Heart size top normal.  Normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette.

        "FINDINGS": "Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG, with again most of the sternotomy wires seemed to be fractured.  A left-sided AICD is stable in position. Minimal left base atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view, which may be due to a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen.  Calcified nodule in right upper lobe is again consistent with granuloma.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.",

Right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place and there is near-complete resolution of layering right effusion with interval improvement in aeration at the right base where there is now only streaky linear opacities likely reflecting residual atelectasis.  Left lung remains clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A small triangular opacity is noted in the right mid lung which may be vascular confluence; this can be further assessed on followup imaging. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits."

There are opacities within the lung bases and within the right upper lobe which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. Followup to resolution is recommended.  No pneumothoraces are identified."
