Minimal fullness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though the difference may merely be an indication of change in position.  Similarly, there is increasing prominence of the mediastinum, though it is difficult to determine whether this merely reflects the AP supine position.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
