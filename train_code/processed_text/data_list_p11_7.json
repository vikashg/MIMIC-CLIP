Relatively symmetric perihilar and basal consolidative abnormality, right greater than left accompanied by very small right pleural effusion could be atypical edema. There is no way to exclude multifocal pneumonia, but it is quite extensive and sudden, which should be apparent clinically. New right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the low SVC and upper right atrium.  Contralateral shift of the trachea is new, probably a small hematoma.  When I discussed the case with the house officer caring for this patient, he volunteered that the patient had received a blood product transfusion several hours before this study, and, of course the findings fit well with TRALI."
