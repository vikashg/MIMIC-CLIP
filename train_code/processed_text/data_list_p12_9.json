        "FINDINGS": "AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding AP and lateral chest view examination of ___. Paying attention to differences in patient's position, the heart size has not changed significantly, thus no signs of gross cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion can be identified.  In comparison with the previous chest examination, the left-sided hemidiaphragm is more elevated than it was before and this coincides with diffuse haziness in the left lung base with partial obliteration of the diaphragmatic contour.  As the lateral pleural sinus remains free, a finding suggests the possibility of a left lower lobe atelectasis.  Possibility that this includes some pneumonic infiltrates cannot be excluded.  Review is performed of the next previous multiple chest examinations.  On the study of ___ (five days ago), the pulmonary vasculature shows more perivascular haze on the bases, a finding which has normalized on today's examination.  Thus, CHF related to fluid overload was more likely to be present at that time.  Noteworthy is the development of left diaphragmatic elevation and diffuse density in the left lower lobe suggestive of atelectasis.  Possibility of infiltrates in this area cannot be excluded, similar as mentioned on a previous episode identified on chest examination of ___.  Similar as seen on previous examination, rather prominent gas distention of colon and small bowel is noted.  There is no evidence of free subdiaphragmatic air.",
