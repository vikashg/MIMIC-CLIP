The heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Although this may reflect cardiomegaly, a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There is mild interstitial edema.  There is likely a small, left greater than right layering effusions.  The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is also a rounded opacity in the aortopulmonary window, which may simply reflect a prominent pulmonary artery as this appears to be present on only some of the previous studies and therefore a vascular etiology would be more likely than lymphadenopathy."
