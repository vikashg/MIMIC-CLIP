There is mild cardiac enlargement.  There is a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly but no marked left atrial enlargement can be identified.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated to a moderate degree and calcium deposits are seen in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  The lateral view discloses a few semicircular calcifications within the heart shadow at the area of the expected aortic valve.  This finding is strongly suggestive of and confirms the clinical diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis. No suspicious calcifications are seen in the mitral valve area and if left atrial enlargement is present, it appears to be mild to moderate.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exists, however, an increased interstitial pattern on the bases, which is otherwise more translucent and characterized by rather low positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms. Discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  When comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, an increased interstitial markings on the bases was already present at that time.  As there was no evidence of pleural effusion or other signs of parenchymal infiltrates, the findings raise the suspicion for some idiopathic pulmonary basal fibrosis. The previous examination also demonstrated on the lateral view some suspicious small calcifications in the aortic valve area and apparently the patient had a similar diagnosis at that time.

Opacities within the right hilum and right upper lobe abutting the fissure are unchanged, and compatible with known malignancy.  Indistinctness and engorgement of the pulmonary vascular markings with associated haziness in the right lung likely reflects lymphangitic spread of tumor, though volume overload is not excluded, with increasing hazy opacification in the right lung base.  Slight worsening of the streaky ill-defined opacity within the right lung base may also reflect right basilar atelectasis and/or infection.  There is hyperinflation of the left lung with no new focal areas of consolidation identified.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A Pleurx catheter is seen with tip terminating at the right basilar hemithorax with a small right pleural effusion again noted, unchanged. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.",
        "IMPRESSION": " 1.  Increased opacification within the right lung base may reflect worsening atelectasis and/or infection with superimposed lymphangitic spread of tumor or asymmetric pulmonary edema. 2.  Small right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged, with Pleurx catheter in place. 3.  Re- demonstration of right hilar and right upper lobe masses compatible with known malignancy."
