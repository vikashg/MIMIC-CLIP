Constant extent of the known left pleural effusion, combined to retrocardiac atelectasis.  The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  There is minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The sternal wires are in constant position. Normal position of the left PICC line."

A new opacity in the right mid lung may be atelectasis but could represent pneumonia in the right clinical setting. The left lung remains clear.  Enlarged appearing heart may be technical from persistence of low lung volumes.  Unchanged positioning of right internal jugular central line and feeding tube.  Median sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. No pneumothorax.",
