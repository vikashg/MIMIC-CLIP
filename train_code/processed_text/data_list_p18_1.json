With regard to the question concerning rib fractures, the previous torso CT examination of ___ is reviewed.  Rib injuries consisted of minimally displaced right transverse process fractures involving L2 through L4.  In addition to bilateral first rib fractures, there were injuries in the medial posterior portions of the left second, third, and fourth rib.  Mildly comminuted fractures existed also posteriorly in the eighth and ninth rib, with slight displacement.  There was also a fracture of the scapula.  All these injuries are impossible to identify in detail on the routine PA and lateral chest examination.  Assessment for possible changes of these injuries would require performance of a followup CT examination.  Gross changes in position cannot be identified.",
