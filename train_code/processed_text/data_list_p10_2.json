Atelectasis due to longstanding bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe is slightly more pronounced today. Chest CT on ___ showed granulomatous calcifications in right hilar lymph nodes and in the right lung and small impactions in dilated bronchi, predominantly in the middle lobe.  The impactions and granulomata might be responsible for suggestion of two tiny lung nodules projecting over the anterior aspect of the right seventh rib that are so small that they could have been present previously but not appreciated. Given that treatment for breast carcinoma took place approximately ___ years ago, I strongly doubt that these tiny nodules, if present at all, are due to intrathoracic malignancy  There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of hilar adenopathy.
