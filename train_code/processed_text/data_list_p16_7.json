In view of the larger inspiration, there is probably overall little change in the right basilar opacification. Two smaller opacities in the left mid lung are likely atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Sclerotic bone lesions are again seen in the left humeral head and the thoracic spine.",

Left lung base opacity is more likely atelectasis.  Heart size is enlarged due to the lung volume. There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC ends in cavoatrial junction.  Abdominal catheters are related to recent pancreatic surgery. Plastic biliary stent has been removed. There is also moderate gastric distention.",

IJ catheter is seen in unchanged position terminating within the upper right atrium.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and demonstrates a mildly enlarged heart.",

Asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial pattern has slightly worsened. Although possibly due to asymmetrical edema, superimposed infectious process should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. As some of the opacities in the right lung have a somewhat nodular contour, followup radiographs to ensure complete resolution are suggested. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax."
