        "FINDINGS": "As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new third left-sided chest tube.  The other multiple right and left-sided chest and mediastinal tubes are unchanged.  There is a minimal pneumothorax restricted to the left lung bases, in the region of the costophrenic sinus, adjacent to known left lateral rib fractures. No apical pneumothorax is visible on the CT examination.  Unchanged other monitoring and support devices with rather extensive right chest wall opacity and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal soft tissue air inclusion in the left lateral soft tissues.",

        "FINDINGS": "Artifact from trauma board is present.  The lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding, but there is no focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Although this study is limited for assessment of osseous structures, there is no evidence of rib fracture.",
        "IMPRESSION": "No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes."

        "FINDINGS": " 6 mm nodular opacity is seen projecting over the right mid to lower lung, between the posterior right ninth and tenth ribs.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The aorta is calcified.  No pulmonary edema.",
        "IMPRESSION": " 6 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid to lower lung, between the posterior right ninth and tenth ribs. While findings could relate to vascular structure, pulmonary nodule is not excluded. Recommend either shallow oblique views or nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation."

        "FINDINGS": " The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lung volumes are slightly low. There is a trace right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion. There is a small opacity at the base of the left lung which may represent compressive atelectasis.  Slightly increased opacity involving the right lower lobe is improved from the prior examination on ___. No pneumothorax is detected.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.",
        "IMPRESSION": " Compared to previous postoperative radiograph of ___, bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size and a right PICC basilar focus of atelectasis has essentially resolved.  Left lower lobe opacity has decreased in extent and may reflect slowly resolving atelectasis or potentially a focus of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting."

        "FINDINGS": "PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from ___.  As on prior, lungs are hyperinflated.  Bronchiectasis with areas of bronchial wall thickening are again seen.  Retrocardiac region demonstrates slightly more conspicuous opacity when compared to prior raising possibility of superimposed acute infection.  Elsewhere, the appearance of the lungs has not changed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Lower cervical/upper thoracic anterior spinal fixation hardware again noted.",
        "IMPRESSION": "Chronic lung disease with possible superimposed new consolidation at the left lung base."
