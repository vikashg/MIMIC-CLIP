Overall cardiac an mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current study. Lung volumes are lower with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  A curvilinear lucency underneath the right hemidiaphragm may be artifactual or but does raise concern of free air. Clinical correlation is recommended and followup imaging may be helpful. NOTIFICATION phone on ___ at 16"
