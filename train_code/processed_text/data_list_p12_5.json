The walls of giant bullae mimic a pleural edge, and it is possible that adhesions developing in the pleural space could, in turn mimic the walls of bullae.  My best judgment, however, is that there is no appreciable residual pneumothorax.  If there were, there would be a fluid level with respect to the small right pleural effusion.  The fluid level one can see on the current lateral view is in the stomach. Spontaneous pneumothorax even in patients with severe emphysema is relatively rare and raises concern for predisposing conditions such as a subpleural malignancy.  At some point, it would be prudent to perform a chest CT looking for malignancy, and it might be necessary to do a chest CT to exclude pneumothorax."
